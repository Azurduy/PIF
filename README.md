Pruning based on Information Flow

This repository contains code corresponding to 
the masther's thesis
"Interpretable AI and Neural Network
Pruning based on Information Flow" 
(author: Florian Heitmann).

The code blocks 
"NodeStructure",
"NNCorrelationMatrix",
"train_nn_iris"
are mostly identical (with a few modifications) to the originals from 
https://github.com/covit2019/analysis_codes
corresponding to 
Kubo, Yusuke et al. (2020). “A copula-based visualization technique for a neural network”.

The other blocks are original and implement the new
pruning approach mentioned above.
"pruning_comparison" has the highest hierarchy and shows how
to apply the other parts, so this is a good starting point.

The code snippets in the file "others" can be ignored.

The required libraries and versions are detailed in "requirements.txt".
